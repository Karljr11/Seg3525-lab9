    description:
      `Before offering our services to everyone, we have been taking care of professional athletes at the highest level for the past 15 years. 
      We started off as a group of friends were each of us were working with different professional teams like the Los Angeles Lakers, Toronto Raptors, Manchester United and the New England Patriots. 
      Then after those 15 years of experience, we decided to come together and create ProZone, a training facility that offers some professional training to anyone that wishes to become a pro athlete one day or someone that just wants professional training.
      We were able to do all of this with the help of our sponsors the Toronto Raptors and Toronto Fc`,
